# Email Database w/ Announcements

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This Python program uses the EZGmail API to allow for a user to send an email "announcement" to multiple other emails inside of a database. The TKinter library was utilized to provide a simple GUI for users to input, delete, and print the current emails inside of the database, as well as send an email by providing a subject line and body paragraph.</p>
<p>The database works by storing the emails inside of a text file.</p>
